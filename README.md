This app allows you to create interactive quizzes using AI. It's handy to check your knowledge about a specific topic. You can add your content, which the quiz will be based on.
I wrote this app entirely on the front end, so you can run it directly from your phone (yes, from your phone as it's not optimized very well to be used on larger screens).

I copied most of this app's code from my other project and made it work without a backend.

I also tried to add an option to import PDF files instead of just pasting the content you want to use to generate the quiz but it didn't work very well in a browser.
